I never believed that I would concede and let someone trample on me 
You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but you were just gaslighting me 
I’ve opened my eyes, & counted the lies, & now it is clearer to me 
You are just a user, and an abuser, living vicariously 
 
I never believed that I would concede and get myself blown asunder
You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but now you have pushed me under 
I’ve opened my eyes, and counted the lies,  now it is clearer to me 
You are just a user, and an abuser, and I refuse to take it 
 
Won’t stand down 
I’m growing stronger 
Won’t stand down 
I’m owned no longer 
Won’t stand down 
You’ve used me for too long, now die alone
